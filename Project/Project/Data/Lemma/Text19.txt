in information technology and computer science a program be describe as stateful if it be design to remember precede event or user interactions; the remember information be call the state of the system 
the set of state a system can occupy be know as its state space in a discrete system the state space be countable and often finite and the system internal behaviour or interaction with its environment consist of separately occur individual action or event such as accept input or produce output that may or may not cause the system to change its state example of such system be digital logic circuit and component automata and formal language computer program and computer the output of a digital circuit or computer program at any time be completely determine by its current input and its state
