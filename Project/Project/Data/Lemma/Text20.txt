in mathematics a equation be a statement that assert the equality of two expression the word equation and its cognate in other language may have subtly different meanings; for example in french a ï¿½quation be define as contain one or more variable while in english any equality be a equation 
solve a equation contain variable consist of determine which value of the variable make the equality true variable be also call unknowns and the value of the unknowns that satisfy the equality be call solutionsof the equation there be two kind of equations: identity and conditional equation a identity be true for all value of the variable a conditional equation be only true for particular value of the variable 
an equation be write as two expression connect by a equal sign "=" the expression on the two side of the equal sign be call the "left-hand side" and "right-hand side" of the equation 
the most common type of equation be a algebraic equation in which the two side be algebraic expression each side of a algebraic equation will contain one or more term for example the equation
have left-hand side which have three term and right-hand side consist of just one term the unknowns be x and y and the parameter be a b and c 
an equation be analogous to a scale into which weight be place when equal weight of something grain for example be place into the two pan the two weight cause the scale to be in balance and be said to be equal if a quantity of grain be remove from one pan of the balance a equal amount of grain must be remove from the other pan to keep the scale in balance likewise to keep a equation in balance the same operation of addition subtraction multiplication and division must be perform on both side of a equation for it to remain true 
in geometry equation be use to describe geometric figure as the equation that be consider such as implicit equation or parametric equation have infinitely many solution the objective be now different: instead of give the solution explicitly or count them which be impossible one use equation for study property of figure this be the start idea of algebraic geometry a important area of mathematics 
algebra study two main family of equations: polynomial equation and among them the special case of linear equation when there be only one variable polynomial equation have the form p x = 0 where p be a polynomial and linear equation have the form ax + b = 0 where a and b be parameter to solve equation from either family one use algorithmic or geometric technique that originate from linear algebra or mathematical analysis algebra also study diophantine equation where the coefficient and solution be integer the technique use be different and come from number theory these equation be difficult in general; one often search just to find the existence or absence of a solution and if they exist to count the number of solution 
differential equation be equation that involve one or more function and their derivative they be solve by finding a expression for the function that do not involve derivative differential equation be use to model process that involve the rate of change of the variable and be use in area such as physics chemistry biology and economics 
the "=" symbol which appear in every equation be invent in 1557 by robert recorde who consider that nothing could be more equal than parallel straight line with the same length
