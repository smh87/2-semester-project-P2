in control engineering a state-space representation be a mathematical model of a physical system as a set of input output and state variable relate by first-order differential equation or difference equation state variable be variable whose value evolve through time in a way that depend on the value they have at any give time and also depend on the externally impose value of input variable output variablesï¿½ value depend on the value of the state variable 
the "state space" be the euclidean space in which the variable on the axe be the state variable the state of the system can be represent as a vector within that space 
to abstract from the number of input output and state these variable be express as vector additionally if the dynamical system be linear time-invariant and finite-dimensional then the differential and algebraic equation may be write in matrix form the state-space method be characterize by significant algebraization of general system theory which make it possible to use kronecker vector-matrix structure the capacity of these structure can be efficiently apply to research system with modulation or without it the state-space representation also know as the "time-domain approach" provide a convenient and compact way to model and analyze system with multiple input and output with input and output we would otherwise have to write down laplace transform to encode all the information about a system unlike the frequency domain approach the use of the state-space representation be not limit to system with linear component and zero initial condition the state-space model be use in many different area in econometrics the state-space model can be use for forecast stock price and numerous other variable
