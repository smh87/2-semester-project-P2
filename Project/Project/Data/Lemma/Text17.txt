space be the boundless three-dimensional extent in which object and event have relative position and direction physical space be often conceive in three linear dimension although modern physicist usually consider it with time to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum know as spacetime the concept of space be consider to be of fundamental importance to a understanding of the physical universe however disagreement continue between philosopher over whether it be itself a entity a relationship between entity or part of a conceptual framework 
debate concern the nature essence and the mode of existence of space date back to antiquity; namely to treatise like the timaeus of plato or socrate in his reflection on what the greek call kh�ra i e "space" or in the physics of aristotle book iv delta in the definition of topos i e place or in the later "geometrical conception of place" as "space qua extension" in the discourse on place qawl fi al-makan of the 11th-century arab polymath alhazen many of these classical philosophical question be discuss in the renaissance and then reformulate in the 17th century particularly during the early development of classical mechanic in isaac newton's view space be absolute�in the sense that it exist permanently and independently of whether there be any matter in the space other natural philosopher notably gottfry leibniz thought instead that space be in fact a collection of relation between object give by their distance and direction from one another in the 18th century the philosopher and theologian george berkeley attempt to refute the "visibility of spatial depth" in his essay towards a new theory of vision later the metaphysician immanuel kant said that the concept of space and time be not empirical one derive from experience of the outside world�they be element of a already give systematic framework that human possess and use to structure all experience kant refer to the experience of "space" in his critique of pure reason as being a subjective "pure a priori form of intuition" 
in the 19th and 20th century mathematician begin to examine geometry that be non-euclidean in which space be conceive as curve rather than flat accord to albert einstein's theory of general relativity space around gravitational field deviate from euclidean space experimental test of general relativity have confirm that non-euclidean geometry provide a better model for the shape of space
