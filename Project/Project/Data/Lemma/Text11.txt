the scientific method be a empirical method of acquire knowledge that have characterize the development of science since at least the 17th century it involve careful observation apply rigorous skepticism about what be observe give that cognitive assumption can distort how one interpret the observation it involve formulate hypothesis via induction base on such observations; experimental and measurement-based test of deductionsdrawn from the hypotheses; and refinement or elimination of the hypothesis base on the experimental finding these be principle of the scientific method as distinguish from a definitive series of step applicable to all scientific enterprise 
though diverse model for the scientific method be available there be in general a continuous process that include observation about the natural world people be naturally inquisitive so they often come up with question about thing they see or hear and they often develop idea or hypothesis about why thing be the way they be the best hypothesis lead to prediction that can be test in various way the most conclusive test of hypothesis come from reasoning base on carefully control experimental data depend on how well additional test match the prediction the original hypothesis may require refinement alteration expansion or even rejection if a particular hypothesis become very well support a general theory may be develop 
although procedure vary from one field of inquiry to another they be frequently the same from one to another the process of the scientific method involve making conjecture hypothesis derive prediction from them as logical consequence and then carry out experiment or empirical observation base on those prediction a hypothesis be a conjecture base on knowledge obtain while seek answer to the question the hypothesis might be very specific or it might be broad scientist then test hypothesis by conduct experiment or study a scientific hypothesis must be falsifiable imply that it be possible to identify a possible outcome of a experiment or observation that conflict with prediction deduce from the hypothesis; otherwise the hypothesis cannot be meaningfully test 
the purpose of a experiment be to determine whether observation agree with or conflict with the prediction derive from a hypothesis experiment can take place anywhere from a garage to cern's large hadron collid there be difficulty in a formulaic statement of method however though the scientific method be often present as a fix sequence of step it represent rather a set of general principle not all step take place in every scientific inquiry nor to the same degree and they be not always in the same order some philosopher and scientist have argue that there be no scientific method; they include physicist lee smolin and philosopher paul feyerabend in his against method robert nola and howard sankey remark that "for some the whole idea of a theory of scientific method be yester-year debate the continuation of which can be sum up as yet more of the proverbial deceased equine castigation we beg to differ
