in mathematics and computer science a algorithm be a unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problem algorithm can perform calculation data processing automate reasoning and other task 
a a effective method a algorithm can be express within a finite amount of space and time and in a well-defined formal language for calculate a function start from a initial state and initial input perhaps empty the instruction describe a computation that when execute proceed through a finite number of well-defined successive state eventually produce "output" and terminate at a final end state the transition from one state to the next be not necessarily deterministic; some algorithm know as randomize algorithm incorporate random input 
the concept of algorithm have exist for century greek mathematician use algorithm in the sieve of eratosthene for finding prime number and the euclidean algorithm for finding the great common divisor of two number 
the word algorithm itself be derive from the 9th century mathematician muammad ibn musa al-khwarizmi latinize algoritmi a partial formalization of what would become the modern concept of algorithm begin with attempt to solve the entscheidungsproblem decision problem pose by david hilbert in 1928 later formalization be frame as attempt to define "effective calculability" or "effective method" those formalization include the g�del�herbrand�kleene recursive function of 1930 1934 and 1935 alonzo church lambda calculus of 1936 emil post formulation 1 of 1936 and alan turing ture machine of 1936�37 and 1939
