in compute plain text be a loose term for data e g file content that represent only character of readable material but not its graphical representation nor other object floating-point number image etc it may also include a limit number of character that control simple arrangement of text such as space line break or tabulation character although tab character can "mean" many different thing so be hardly "plain" plain text be different from format text where style information be included; from structure text where structural part of the document such as paragraph section and the like be identify ; and from binary file in which some portion must be interpret as binary object encode integer real number image etc 
the term be sometimes use quite loosely to mean file that contain only "readable" content or just file with nothing that the speaker do+not prefer for example that could exclude any indication of font or layout such as markup markdown or even tab ; character such as curly quote non-breaking space soft hyphen em dash and/or ligatures; or other thing 
in principle plain text can be in any encode but occasionally the term be take to imply ascii as unicode-based encoding such as utf-8 and utf-16 become more common that usage may be shrink 
plain text be also sometimes use only to exclude "binary" files: those in which at least some part of the file cannot be correctly interpret via the character encode in effect for example a file or string consist of "hello" in whatever encode following by 4 byte that express a binary integer that be not just a character be a binary file not plain text by even the loose common usage put another way translate a plain text file to a character encode that use entirely different number to represent character do not change the meaning so long as you know what encode be in use but for binary file such a conversion do change the meaning of at least some part of the file 
file that contain markup or other meta-data be generally consider plain-text so long as the markup be also in directly human-readable form as in html xml and so on as coomb renear and derose argue punctuation be itself markup; and no one consider punctuation to disqualify a file from being plain text 
the use of plain text rather than binary file enable file to survive much better "in the wild" in part by making them largely immune to computer architecture incompatibility for example all the problem of endianness can be avoid with encoding such as ucs-2 rather than utf-8 endianness matter but uniformly for every character rather than for potentially-unknown subset of it 
accord to the unicode standard 
�	"plain text be a pure sequence of character codes; plain un-encode text be therefore a sequence of unicode character code "
�	styled text also know as rich text be any text representation contain plain text complete by information such as a language identifier font size color hypertext link 
�	 thus representation such as sgml rtf html xml wiki markup and tex as well as nearly all program language source code file be consider plain text the particular content be irrelevant to whether a file be plain text for example a svg file can express drawing or even bitmap graphic but be still plain text 
accord to the unicode standard plain text have two main property in regard to rich text:
�	"plain text be the underlie content stream to which format can be apply "
�	"plain text be public standardize and universally readable �
