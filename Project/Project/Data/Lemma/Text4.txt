in set theory and its application throughout mathematics a class be a collection of set or sometimes other mathematical object that can be unambiguously define by a property that all its member share the precise definition of "class" depend on foundational context in work on zermelo�fraenkel set theory the notion of class be informal whereas other set theory such as von neumann�bernays�g�del set theory axiomatize the notion of "proper class" e g as entity that be not member of another entity 
a class that be not a set informally in zermelo�fraenkel be call a proper class and a class that be a set be sometimes call a small class for instance the class of all ordinal number and the class of all set be proper class in many formal system 
outside set theory the word "class" be sometimes use synonymously with "set" this usage date from a historical period where class and set be not distinguish as they be in modern set-theoretic terminology many discussion of "classes" in the 19th century and early be really refer to set or perhaps to a more ambiguous concept
