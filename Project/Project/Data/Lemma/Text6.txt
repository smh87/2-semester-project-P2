this contrast deeply with a morpheme which be the small unit of meaning but will not necessarily stand on its own a word may consist of a single morpheme for example: oh! rock red quick run expect or several rock redness quickly running unexpected whereas a morpheme may not be able to stand on its own as a word in the word just mention these be - -ness -ly - un- - a complex word will typically include a root and one or more affix rock- red-ness quick-ly run-n un-expect- or more than one root in a compound black-board sand-box word can be put together to build large element of language such as phrase a red rock put up with clause i throw a rock and sentence he throw a rock too but he miss 
the term word may refer to a speak word or to a write word or sometimes to the abstract concept behind either speak word be made up of unit of sound call phoneme and write word of symbol call grapheme such as the letter of the english alphabet
